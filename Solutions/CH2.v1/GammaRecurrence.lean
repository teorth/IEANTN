# Stages 2b and 2e: the recurrence for the Gauss series, and its value at the integers

Two of the three hypotheses of the vanishing lemma, for `E := ψ - G` where

  `G s := -γ + ∑ₖ (1/(k+1) - 1/(k+s))`.

* **2b**, `gaussSum_add_one`: `G(s+1) = G(s) + 1/s`. With `Complex.digamma_apply_add_one` this is
  what makes `E` 1-periodic. The proof is a telescoping series: subtracting the two Gauss series
  termwise cancels the `1/(k+1)` and leaves `1/(k+s) - 1/(k+1+s)`, whose partial sums are
  `1/s - 1/(n+s)`.
* **2e**, `digamma_eq_gaussSum_nat_add_one`: `ψ(n+1) = G(n+1)`, both sides being `-γ + Hₙ`.

## What the Mathlib bump changed here

The node's `formalization.yaml` records that `Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Gamma/Digamma.lean` "is 64
lines and contains the definition, `digamma_zero`, `digamma_one`, `digamma_one_half`,
`digamma_apply_add_one` and `meromorphic_digamma`, and no bound of any kind." **That was true when
it was written and is no longer true.** On this repository's pin the file is 153 lines and also
carries `digamma_apply_add_nat`, `digamma_nat_add_one`, Euler's reflection formula
`digamma_one_sub`, and the duplication formula `digamma_two_mul`.

The half of that observation which still holds is the operative one: there is still no bound of
any kind, so the node's conclusion is still open and the Gauss representation is still a `TODO` in
that file. But `digamma_nat_add_one` is exactly step 2e's `ψ` side, so that step is now two
`rw`s rather than an induction, and the `limitations` entry saying the reflection formula awaits a
future bump has been overtaken by the bump that already happened.

Stated for its own sake rather than inlined, because the argument is entirely about partial sums
and has nothing to do with `Γ` — and stated over an arbitrary complete normed group because it is
used twice at different types: over `ℂ` for the recurrence below, and over `ℝ` in
`Oscillation.lean`, where the same telescoping sums `1/((k+t)(k+t+1))` to `1/t`. -/
