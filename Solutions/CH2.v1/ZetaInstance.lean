# Instantiating §5 at `A(s) = -ζ'(s)/ζ(s)`

The first consumer of the ported §5 machinery, and the step that tells us whether that machinery is
*usable* rather than merely compiling.

Chirre–Helfgott's §10 (`prop:sagaro`) says what is wanted:

> Apply Theorem 1.1 with `A(s) = -ζ'(s)/ζ(s)`. The poles of `A(s)` are the zeros of `ζ(s)` and the
> pole of `ζ(s)` at `s = 1`. The residue of `A(s)` at a zero of `ζ(s)` is `-1` times the zero's
> multiplicity, and its residue at `s = 1` is `1`.

`prop_5_2` asks for five things about `F`. This file discharges the three that are properties of
`ζ` alone; the other two are growth bounds and belong with Appendix A. See the end of the file.

## The one that mattered

`HasSimplePolesOn` was the hypothesis I expected to be awkward — `−ζ'/ζ` has a pole at every zero of
`ζ`, of every multiplicity, and "simple pole regardless of multiplicity" is exactly the sort of fact
that is obvious on paper and painful in Lean. It is not painful: Mathlib has
`meromorphicOrderAt_logDeriv_eq_neg_one`, which says the logarithmic derivative has order exactly
`-1` at any zero or pole of a meromorphic function. A zero of order `m` gives `m/(s-ρ) + …`, order
`-1`, whatever `m` is.

That is worth recording because it also decides an earlier question: `ContourIntegration.v1`'s
general residue theorem, which admits arbitrary isolated singularities, is stronger than this
application ever needs.

/-! ### Closing the two gaps

`riemannZeta₀` and `riemannZeta₁` from `Mathlib.NumberTheory.Harmonic.ZetaAsymp` are what make this
work: `ζ s = (s-1)⁻¹ + riemannZeta₀ s` away from `1`, with `riemannZeta₀` **entire**. That gives
meromorphy at the pole directly, rather than through a removable-singularity argument.

The non-vanishing is then the identity theorem, which Mathlib has for meromorphic order:
`meromorphicOrderAt_ne_top_of_isPreconnected` transports "order `≠ ⊤`" across a preconnected set.
Seeding it at `s = 2`, where `ζ` is analytic and non-zero, gives it everywhere. -/

Note this includes `s = 1`: Mathlib's `meromorphicOrderAt_logDeriv_eq_neg_one` applies at poles as
well as zeros, and `ζ` has a simple pole there, so `A` has order `-1` at `1` too. -/
