# Glue: `Complex.digamma` on the real axis

Stage 1 proves `|ψ(x) - log x| ≤ 1/x` for the *real* function `deriv (fun t ↦ log (Γ t))`, because
Mathlib has no `Real.digamma` and the convexity argument is real-variable throughout. The node's
conclusion is about `Complex.digamma`. This file is the one step between them:

  `Complex.digamma x = ↑(deriv (fun t ↦ Real.log (Real.Gamma t)) x)` for real `x > 0`.

Both sides are `Γ'/Γ`; the content is that `Complex.Gamma` differentiated along the real axis is
the real `Γ'`, which is not automatic — a complex-differentiable function agreeing with a real one
on `ℝ` has a complex derivative that *happens* to be real there, and saying so takes an argument.

**Mathlib has that argument and keeps it `private`.** `HasDerivAt.complex_of_real` in
`NumberTheory/Harmonic/GammaDeriv.lean` is exactly it, marked `private`, so it cannot be imported
and is reproved here verbatim. If any of this goes upstream, that lemma losing its `private` is
the first thing to ask for; `Complex.digamma_ofReal` below is the second.
