# Stages 2c and 2g: `G` is analytic, and `ψ = G` on the right half-plane

`RealIdentity.lean` has `ψ = G` on the positive real axis. This file carries it to the complex
plane by the identity theorem, which needs both sides analytic on a connected open set containing
those reals.

## The domain is the right half-plane, not the slit plane, and that is a choice

The natural maximal domain is `ℂ \ {0, -1, -2, …}`, and the identity is true there. What is proved
here is the restriction to `{s | 0 < Re s}`, for two reasons:

* **It is everything the node needs.** The conclusion quantifies over `1 ≤ Re w`, which is well
  inside. Nothing downstream asks for more.
* **It makes the uniform bound one line instead of a case split.** The hypothesis of
  `differentiableOn_tsum_of_summable_norm` is a bound *uniform on the set*, and on a half-plane
  `‖k + s‖ ≥ Re (k + s) = k + Re s`, which is exactly what is wanted. On a neighbourhood inside the
  slit plane the same bound needs the poles handled separately: one shows `‖s + k‖ > r` for every
  `k` from `closedBall s₀ r ⊆ U` and `-k ∉ U`, then splits the comparison series at `k ≈ 2‖s₀‖`
  because the two bounds cross there. That is perfectly doable and is the shape a Mathlib version
  should take; it is not done here because it would be work the node cannot use.

So `digamma_eq_gaussSum` below is weaker than the truth, deliberately, and the gap is recorded
rather than hidden. **Anyone extending this to the slit plane changes only this file** — the
statements before it are already about the general case, and Stage 3 only ever evaluates at
`Re w ≥ 1`.

## Why analyticity was not needed earlier

Nothing in stages 1 and 2a–2f uses it: that whole argument runs along the real axis, where `G` is a
convergent series of real terms and the vanishing lemma is a statement about functions on `ℝ`.
Analyticity is needed only to *transport* the identity, which is this file's only job.

/-- **The bound that makes the series locally uniformly convergent.**

On `Re s ≥ δ` with `‖s‖ ≤ M` and `0 < δ ≤ 1`, every term is at most `(M+1)/(δ (k+1)²)`.

The half-plane is doing the work: `‖k + s‖ ≥ Re (k + s) = k + Re s ≥ k + δ`, and then
`(k+1)(k+δ) ≥ δ (k+1)²` because `δ ≤ 1`. No case split on `k`. -/
